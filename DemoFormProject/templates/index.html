        <h2>What is it?</h2>
        <p>

        <p>
            I chose this topic because I was interested to see how
            the pollution in the land happens
            and how people treat it and restore the land.

        <p>
            Western soil remediation involves many professionals: hydrologists, geologists, soil engineers
            , building engineers, mechanical engineers, environmental engineers, architects
            , civil engineers and more. The soil treatments are divided into different types:
            biological treatment, thermal treatment, chemical treatment and combinations between the different treatments.
            There are many and varied technologies available to treat contaminated soils.
